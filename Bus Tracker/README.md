# Real-time bus locations
This app gathers the current location for every bus currently on the road, per the API information, and prints it to the map. 

# How to run it
You can run it via my own portfolio website.

# Future improvements
My original plan was to do this for buses in Ukraine, where I am located. However, there is an application process to get API access that I am waiting on. In the next iteration I will change this app to be Ukraine based.
